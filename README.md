## Usage

`Focus` Coordinates range between `-1` and `1` for both `x` and `y` axes. The [`FocusPicker`](#focuspicker) class will help enable users to select the focus point to be used with an image.

Additionally, because the `FocusedImage` is positioned absolutely so it can shift as needed, its container needs to manage its own height and width. If you aren't seeing an image appear at all, it is likely that the div's height is fully collapsed.

### FocusedImage

There are two ways to supply the coordinates when initializing the `FocusedImage` class

#### Data Tags

```html
<div class="focused-image-container">
  <img class="focused-image" src="https://picsum.photos/2400/1400" data-focus-x="0.34" data-focus-y="-0.21">
</div>
```

```ts
import { FocusedImage } from "image-focus"

const img = document.querySelector('.focused-image') as HTMLImageElement
const focusedImage = new FocusedImage(img)
```

#### Using `focus` Option

```html
<div class="focused-image-container">
  <img class="focused-image" src="https://picsum.photos/2400/1400">
</div>
```

```ts
import { FocusedImage } from "image-focus"

const img = document.querySelector('.focused-image') as HTMLImageElement
const focusedImage = new FocusedImage(img, {
  focus: {
    x: 0.34,
    y: -0.21
  }
})
```

### FocusPicker

Provide an `onChange` callback that will receive a `Focus` object that has `x` and `y` properties for the newly selected coordinates. Optionally supply a `focus` to initialize with, or a `retina` src to use instead of the default white ring SVG.

```ts
const focusPickerEl = document.getElementById("focus-picker-img") as HTMLImageElement
const focusPicker = new FocusPicker(focusPickerEl, {
  onChange: focus => {
    focusedImages.forEach(focusedImage => focusedImage.setFocus(focus))
    updateCoordinatesValue(focus)
  },
  focus: startingFocus,
})
```

## What if I'm not using npm and a build process?

That's okay! [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) has you covered. Just add this script tag to your page and the `image-focus` module is exposed in the global namespace under `window.imageFocus`.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/image-focus"></script>
```
